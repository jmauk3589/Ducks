This file is just used to start the extra content. Hopefully you uncommented the "sendInfo()" method in the mammals.js
if not, please do that now and come back here afterwards.

What we are going to do is send the information YOU ENTER to a new page. We are just going to print it to the screen
but the application is that you can use the information in forms or other calculative processes.

First make a new file in the js folder called "extra"
Then make another file in the web folder called "extraStuffPage"

Once finished copy the code below to the correct page. Feel free to then read the information you copy into
extra.js file.

--------------------------Copy everything between these lines to "extraStuffPage.jsp" -----------------------------

/*
This file is for just a little bit more information.
One little thing that came up across my search was ...
"this is all great - but how can i easily pass a variable to a different page?"

The answer is below.

ok. so remember the youtube video link i included in the bottom of that AddDuck servlet?
Everything after the "?" was just a parameter and didn't pertain to the page itself. So in reality you could say
that every single page on youtube is the same with just a different parameter call. Ok but did it get the variable?
It most likely was linked to the thumbnail like how i mentioned the ID being attached to the button towards the end of
the mammals.js file.

The homepage (youtube.com) is full of thumbnails each with its own thumbnail that
redirects you to youtube.com/watch?v="id for video"

you can also grab the info doing the session.getAttribute() thing we did for the login process, but grabbing
information from the url has its benefits. for one, could you imagine sending people youtube links and it actually working
if youtube hid the value instead of passing it back with the url shown above?


Also - that sendInfo() from the mammals.js file - you can send the info back to a servlet, get a response, and then
redirect to the page with that info or just redirect from the servlet itself. overall passing values between pages has
multiple routes so use whichever one works best for your scenario.

// Below this line is used for the extraStuffPage.jsp
$(function(){

   document.getElementById("extraPageContent").innerText = getUrlParameter("extraStuff");

});

var getUrlParameter = function getUrlParameter(sParam) {
    var sPageURL = decodeURIComponent(window.location.search.substring(1)), sURLVariables = sPageURL.split('&'), sParameterName, i;

    for (i = 0; i < sURLVariables.length; i++) {
        sParameterName = sURLVariables[i].split('=');

        if (sParameterName[0] === sParam) {
            return sParameterName[1] === undefined ? true : sParameterName[1];
        }
    }
};
